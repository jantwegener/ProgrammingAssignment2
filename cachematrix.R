## The purpose of this R script is to have a matrix that is able to cache its inverse.
## 
## The inverse of a square matrix A is a square matrix B so that AB = I, where I is the identity matrix.
## Note that not every square matrix has an inverse (e.g., matrix(rep(0, 2*2), 2, 2) does not have an inverse matrix).
## This script assumes that the given matrix A is a square matrix and that A has an inverse matrix.
## 
## The script contains two functions, makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve.
## The function makeCacheMatrix creates a new object for caching a matrix and its inverse matrix.
## The function cacheSolve returns the inverse matrix of a matrix created with makeCacheMatrix. It either returns the cached value or it computes the inverse matrix if the cache is empty or not up to date.
## The code for the functions is highly inspired by the given example in https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2/blob/master/README.md.
## 
## In order to test the functions of this script, it is usually sufficient to create a square matrix whose entries are filled by random variables. This works due to the following statement taken from wikipedia.org:
## "A square matrix that is not invertible is called singular or degenerate. A square matrix is singular if and only if its determinant is 0. Singular matrices are rare in the sense that a square matrix randomly selected from a continuous uniform distribution on its entries will almost never be singular." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix]
